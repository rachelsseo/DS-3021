# Rachel's Case Study Responses

## Problem Focus Questions 

#### Q1. What problems are facing the organization?
- Many different variables to consider
- Dataset is small and narrow 
- Success is not defined numerically

#### Q2. What is the target variable and what type (reg or class) of solution are they developing?
- Classification solution
- To develop the best math software to help address:
  - billions of dollars wasted annually in the U.S. education system
  - improving student performance
  - improving teacher satisfaction

#### Q3. How would they know the solution was working (business metric)?
  - Improved student performance
  - Teacher satisfaction 
  - Long-term cost savings

#### Q4. What other issues might the team be facing?
- Biases in the training data
- May not have enough time
- Hard time taking into consideration the different educational priorities, budgets, and cultures of different districts
- Difficulty in receiving feedback once implemented

## Data to Concept Questions 

#### Q1. How difficult is the data to gather?
- Because data is collected through a 60-question survey, there probably aren't many people who would voluntarily take their time to respond without an incentive. 

#### Q2. Is the target difficult to measure or break into smaller parts?
- If the company were to structure data collection in a stratified manner based on districts, educational priorities, budgets, etc. the target would be easier to measure.

#### Q3. What level of uncertainty (risk) are you willing to accept?
- Personally, I would be willing to accept 30% risk while testing because the dataset is small.
