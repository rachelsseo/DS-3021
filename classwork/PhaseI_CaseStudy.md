# Rachel's Case Study Responses

## Problem Focus Questions 

#### Q1. What problems are facing the organization?
  Some problems that the organization is facing are:
- there are many different variables to consider
- the dataset is small and narrow 
- success is not defined numerically; meaning they won't really know what success looks like until they get there 

#### Q2. What is the target variable and what type (reg or class) of solution are they developing?
  The target variable is whether an investment in certain Mathematics software will actually meet the needs, skills, and contexts of individual schools within districts. It is a classification solution.

#### Q3. How would they know the solution was working (business metric)?
  They would know the solution was working based on improved student performance, improved teacher satisfaction, and long-term cost savings.

#### Q4. What other issues might the team be facing?
  Other issues that the team might face are: 
  - biases in the training data
  - working in a tight timeline
  - difficulty taking into consideration the different educational priorities, budgets, and cultures of different districts
  - difficulty in receiving feedback once implemented

## Data to Concept Questions 

#### Q1. How difficult is the data to gather?
The data is collected through a 60-question survey - it is very unlikely that people would voluntarily take their time to respond without an incentive. 

#### Q2. Is the target difficult to measure or break into smaller parts?
  If the company were to structure data collection in a stratified manner based on districts, educational priorities, budgets, etc. the target would be easier to measure, but still difficult if data collection does not prove to be cooperative.

#### Q3. What level of uncertainty (risk) are you willing to accept?
I would be willing to accept 30% risk while testing because of the complexity of the task and it being a somewhat low stakes application for making recommendations.
